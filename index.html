            I am currently a second year Student at the University of the West Indies. 
            First year was fine, I had my classes online and I had more time do complete my assignments. Due to 
            the world getting back to normal, I now have face to face classes that I do not enjoy. Second year is more challenging. 
            I spend long hours away from home and I no longer have as much time to study and do my work. 
        </p> 

        <p>However, I am trying to make the most. I have joined clubs and have had conversations with my classmates. 
            I am currently trying to make friends with those I can, and overall meet new people and network.

            Even though school is important, it is even more important to have interests and leisure activities you can engage
            in, in your free time. I have recently been trying to learn spanish. It has not been going too well so far 
            but I know I will get there someday. Additionally, I have been watching movies and tv shows recently released.
        </p> 

        <p>I have always been a sports fan so recently I have been watching many sports: tennis, Formula 1, Football and so on.</p>
